it reads music blogs so you don't have to. 

the code is crap. i didn't originally plan on open-sourcing (yeah, it's a verb) it but here we are. 

TODO

1. switch hypemachine for skreemr. 
2. clean up the code (i haven't actually looked at it since i wrote it, which means i don't know what i'm committing)
3. get 'frontent' working
4. other stuff
5. add sharing of some sort. wouldn't it be cool if your song_scrape could talk to my song_scrape?
